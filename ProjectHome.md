# jqPageFlow #
A jQuery pagination plugin, similar to that found on Google Reader or dzone.com. For example : you have x number of result items on a page, as you scroll to the bottom of the list the plugin performs an ajax call and loads the next y number of results. Thus the user continues scrolling until the end of the result set, instead of having to manually to click on a "next" link and wait for a page load.

# jqBookmark #
A jQuery browser favorite/bookmark function. Turns a specified anchor element or class of anchor elements into an "Add to bookmarks" link. This then makes use of the brower's built-in "bookmark" functionality to add the anchor's href attribute to the user's favorites. If the browser does not support this functionality, an alert is displayed notifying the user.
